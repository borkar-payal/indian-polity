# Union and Its Territories  
## (UPSC GS-II | Indian Constitution)

---

## 1. Introduction

The concept of **Union and Its Territories** is a foundational pillar of the Indian Constitution.  
Unlike a typical federation formed by an agreement between states, **India is described as a Union of States**, reflecting the **indestructible nature of the Indian Union**.

### Article 1 of the Constitution
> **“India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.”**

This part of the Constitution explains:
- Political and territorial unity of India  
- Classification of territories  
- Parliament’s power to reorganize states

## 2. Meaning of “Union”

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar clarified that:
- Indian federation is **not the result of an agreement** among states
